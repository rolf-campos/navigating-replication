## Replication Code for *“Navigating by Falling Stars: Monetary Policy with Fiscally Driven Natural Rates”*

[Ungated link to the paper](https://rolf-campos.github.io/publication/jpemacro-2026-navigating/jpemacro-2026-navigating.pdf).

This repository contains all the code required to replicate **all computations**, **simulations**, and **empirical estimations** in the paper and its online appendix. The replication package is organized to allow users to reproduce both the model-based results and the empirical evidence.

---

## 1. Computational Requirements

### **Python**
- Tested with **Python 3.10**
- Dependencies:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `jupyter` or `jupyterlab`
  - **Sequence‑Jacobian (SSJ) toolkit v1.0.0**  
    https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian  
    A frozen version of the SSJ toolkit is included in the folder `sequence_jacobian/` to ensure long‑term reproducibility.

### **Stata**
- Tested with **Stata 17**
- No special ado-file dependencies.

### **Matlab**
- Tested with **Matlab R2021b**
- Requires:
  - **VAR Toolbox 3.0** (Ambrogio Cesa‑Bianchi)  
    https://sites.google.com/site/ambropo/MatlabCodes

## 2. Data Availability

### **Main data**
- All files required for the empirical estimation are located in `estimation/data/`.

### **Bundled tools**
- A stable version of the **SSJ toolkit** used in the paper is stored in `sequence_jacobian/`.

### **Estimation results**
- The estimation output used in the paper is stored in:  
  `data/IRF_VAR_LP_paper.xlsx`

## 4. Replicating the Model Computations and Simulations

To reproduce the model-based results:

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in this folder.  
2. Run **notebooks 1 through 7 in numerical order**.  
   Later notebooks rely on intermediate outputs (steady states and IRFs) generated by earlier ones.  
3. Outputs:
   - Steady states → `ss/`
   - IRFs from simulations → `irfs/`
   - Final figures/results → `results/`

---

## 5. Replicating the Empirical Evidence (Figure 3 and Appendix F)

1. Run:
   ```
   8_empirical_evidence.ipynb
   ```
2. This notebook reads the estimation results in `data/IRF_VAR_LP_paper.xlsx` and produces:
   - **Figure 3** (main text)
   - **All figures in Appendix F**

To regenerate the underlying estimation results, follow Section 6 below.

## 6. Instructions to Replicate the Estimation Results

### **A. Local Projections (Stata)**
Run:
```
estimation/LP_Estimation.do
```
This script generates LP‑based IRFs. They have to be transferred manually to the Excel file used by the empirical notebook.

### **B. VAR Estimation (Matlab)**
Run:
```
estimation/code/VAR_Estimation.m
```
This script requires the VAR Toolbox and produces VAR‑based IRFs. They have to be transferred manually to the Excel file.

## 7. Results

The following [document](results_map.md) lists the reproducible outputs generated by each one of the replication notebooks.
